## **\*\*This gem is in alpha stages and is not feature complete. It should not be used in production!\*\***

## Overview

ApiGuardian includes the following features out of the box:

* User registration (email/pass)
* Password reset workflow
* Roles
* Permissions
* Stateless authentication using OAuth2 (via [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) and [Doorkeeper::JWT](https://github.com/chriswarren/doorkeeper-jwt))
* Policy enforcement (via [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit))
* Serialization to [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) (via [AMS](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers))
* Two-factor auth
* External Login (TODO)

What doesn't it include?

* Stateful session support (Cookies)
* HTML/CSS/JS or views of any kind.

## Requirements

* Ruby >= 2.0
* PostgreSQL >= 9.3 (JSON and uuid-ossp support)

**Note: For now, your app must use a PostgreSQL database.** This is because ApiGuardian is using UUID primary keys for all records.

## Installation

### First

Put this in your Gemfile:

```rb
# Include ApiGuardian from edge
gem 'api_guardian', git: 'https://github.com/lookitsatravis/api_guardian'
# You must also include the prerelease version of active_model_serializers
gem 'active_model_serializers', git: 'https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers.git'
```

### Next

Run this command:

```sh
rails generate api_guardian:install
```

This will add an initializer, mount the routes, and copy the migrations files.
You will need to follow this with:

```sh
rake db:migrate
rake api_guardian:seed # not yet implemented, see db/seed.rb for example
```
