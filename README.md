# Api Guardian

Drop in authorization and authentication suite for Rails APIs.

## Overview

ApiGuardian includes the following features out of the box:

* User registration (email/pass)
* Password reset workflow
* Roles
* Permissions
* Stateless authentication using OAuth2 (via [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) and [Doorkeeper::JWT](https://github.com/chriswarren/doorkeeper-jwt))
* Policy enforcement (via [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit))
* Serialization to [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) (via [AMS](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers))
* Two-factor auth (TODO)
* External Login (TODO)

What doesn't it include?

* Stateful session support (Cookies)
* HTML/CSS/JS or views of any kind.

## Requirements

* PostgreSQL >= 9.1 (uuid-ossp support)

**Note: For now, your app must use a PostgreSQL database.** This is because ApiGuardian is using UUID primary keys for all records.
