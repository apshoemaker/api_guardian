## **\*\*This gem is in alpha stages and is not feature complete. It should not be used in production!\*\***

## Overview

ApiGuardian includes the following features out of the box:

* User registration (email/pass)
* Password reset workflow
* Roles
* Permissions
* Stateless authentication using OAuth2 (via [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper) and [Doorkeeper::JWT](https://github.com/chriswarren/doorkeeper-jwt))
* Policy enforcement (via [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit))
* Serialization to [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) (via [AMS](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers))
* Two-factor auth
* External Login (TODO)

What doesn't it include?

* Stateful session support (Cookies)
* HTML/CSS/JS or views of any kind.

## Requirements

* Ruby >= 2.0
* PostgreSQL >= 9.3 (JSON and uuid-ossp support)

**Note: For now, your app must use a PostgreSQL database.** This is because ApiGuardian is using UUID primary keys for all records.

## Installation

### First

Put this in your Gemfile:

```rb
# Include ApiGuardian from edge
gem 'api_guardian', git: 'https://github.com/lookitsatravis/api_guardian'
# You must also include the prerelease version of active_model_serializers
gem 'active_model_serializers', git: 'https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers.git'
```

### Next

Run this command:

```sh
rails generate api_guardian:install
```

This will add an initializer, mount the routes, and copy the migrations files.
You will need to follow this with:

```sh
rake db:migrate
rake api_guardian:seed # not yet implemented, see db/seed.rb for example
```

### Finally

Most of the time, you will want to customize the user model of your application.
To do so, create a new model that includes the ApiGuardian User concern:

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ApiGuardian::Concerns::Models::User

  def my_custom_method
    send_glitter_to_my_enemies
  end
end
```

And then in `config/initializers/api_guardian.rb`:

```rb
ApiGuardian.configure do |config|
  # ...

  config.user_class = 'User'

  # ...
end
```

You will need to restart the server after making this change.

##### Customizing User Table Name

By default, this will use the database table created during install (`api_guardian_users`),
but you can change that by customizing the table name:

```rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ApiGuardian::Concerns::Models::User
  self.table_name = 'my_users'
end
```

Keep in mind that if you do this, the table will need to have the same schema as
`api_guardian_users`.

## Usage

* Organization support
* Seeds + Initial User + Initial Organization
* Explain Roles/Permissions
* Password reset

### Roles

### Permissions

### Users

To Do

### Registration

Registration can be handled in a number of ways. The gist of it is that each
registration strategy has different required fields, but you will always pass in
a `type` attribute to specify the strategy you want to use. If registration
succeeds, the user record will be returned.

Endpoint: POST `{engine_mount_path}/register`

#### via Email

To register a user via email, the following fields are required.

```json
{
  "type": "email",
  "email": "person@example.com",
  "password": "somepassword",
  "password_confirmation": "somepassword"
}
```

#### via [Twitter Digits](https://get.digits.com)

Twitter Digits is a very simple method for a user to register for an app using
only their phone number. Digits handles the phone number validation and 2FA using
Twitter's trusted short code. When initiated via the Digits SDK, a client will receive
an Authorization URL and Header which must be forwarded on to the app where
ApiGuardian is mounted. ApiGuardian will automatically verify the data and make
a request to Digits for the user's phone number and access token which will be stored
as an Identity for that user.

To register a user using Digits, the following fields are required.

```json
{
  "type": "digits",
  "auth_url": "auth_url_returned_from_digits_sdk",
  "auth_header": "auth_header_returned_from_digits_sdk"
}
```

### Authentication

Authentication with ApiGuardian is handled via OAuth2 spec. Upon successfully
authenticating, an access token is returned which sent in all future requests as
a header. *NOTE: Currently, ApiGuardian supports the `password` OAuth2 grant type. Future
additions of the other grant types are on the road map.*

Endpoint: POST `{engine_mount_path}/auth/token`

#### JWT Response

ApiGuardian uses JSON Web Tokens as the generated access token. This is done as a
convenient way to provide clients with a given user's permission set (or claims).
More information on how to parse JWT and validate signatures can be found at
[jwt.io](https://jwt.io). *NOTE: Access Tokens are reused by ApiGuardian. This means
that if there are two or more successful authentications using the same resource owner
and app id, the access token granted will be reused as long as it is still valid.
The purpose of this behavior is to keep data storage low on large applications. It
also makes it easy to revoke tokens since there should only be a single valid one
at any given time.*

The successful authentication response looks like this:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJhcGlfZ3VhcmRpYW4iLCJpYXQiOjE0NTIxODU3NzEsImV4cCI6MTQ1MjE5Mjk3MSwianRpIjoiMGNjMjNjY2ZiODQ5M2M3MDhmMDRhZGZiOTc1YzhhMTAiLCJzdWIiOiIzMzEyMWY5NS1mNzZkLTQ1NjUtOGYwNC00NjgyMjU4NDBlYWIiLCJ1c2VyIjp7ImlkIjoiMzMxMjFmOTUtZjc2ZC00NTY1LThmMDQtNDY4MjI1ODQwZWFiIn0sInBlcm1pc3Npb25zIjpbInJvbGU6bWFuYWdlIiwidXNlcjptYW5hZ2UiLCJwZXJtaXNzaW9uOm1hbmFnZSJdfQ.7cOk5loal4inq7b6qUV68cR5npheIQboqmCDvl0vy7o",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 7200,
  "refresh_token": "59aa75573944f6df61ef9930ca0d8968210339c3d51bb13968604fe0b2123b1a",
  "created_at": 1452185771
}
```

In this case, the JWT payload decodes to the following. You can see that the user's
ID and permissions are included along with some of the standard JWT claims.

```json
{
  "iss": "api_guardian",
  "iat": 1452185771,
  "exp": 1452192971,
  "jti": "0cc23ccfb8493c708f04adfb975c8a10",
  "sub": "33121f95-f76d-4565-8f04-468225840eab",
  "user": {
    "id": "33121f95-f76d-4565-8f04-468225840eab"
  },
  "permissions": [
    "role:manage",
    "user:manage",
    "permission:manage"
  ]
}
```

The JWT issuer and secret can (and should) be customized. Please see configuration
for more.

#### Authenticating via Email

To request an access token via email, the following fields are required.

```json
{
    "username": "person@example.com",
    "password": "somepassword",
    "grant_type": "password"
}
```

#### Authenticating via [Twitter Digits](https://get.digits.com)

Digits also uses the `password` OAuth2 grant type. In this case, the username is
the phone number returned from the Digits SDK. In order to conform to the OAuth2
spec, a special step is needed to transform the Digits auth URL and Header into
a "password". To do this, you must Base64 encode the auth URL and the auth Header
joined by a semicolon. Example in JavaScript ([Digits web SDK docs](https://docs.fabric.io/web/digits/index.html)):

```js
Digits.init({ consumerKey: 'yourConsumerKey' });
Digits.logIn()
  .done(onLogin);

function onLogin(loginResponse){
  var oAuthHeaders = loginResponse.oauth_echo_headers;
  var apiUrl = oAuthHeaders['X-Auth-Service-Provider'];
  var authHeader = oAuthHeaders['X-Verify-Credentials-Authorization'];
  var encodedPassword = window.btoa([apiUrl, authHeader].join(';'))

  //encodedPassword is what you need to supply as the "password" to authenticate with Digits.
}
```

To request an access token via Twitter Digits, the following fields are required.

```js
{
    "username": "+18005551234", //As returned from Digits SDK
    "password": "base_64_encoded_url_and_header",
    "grant_type": "password"
}
```

### Two-Factor Authentication

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) functionality is available out of the box. Requirements:

* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) account

To enable this feature, update the ApiGuardian config in `config/initializers/api_guardian.rb`:

```rb
ApiGuardian.configure do |config|
  # Enable two-factor authentication
  config.enable_2fa = true

  # 2FA header name. This header is used to validate a OTP and can be customized
  # to have the app name, for example.
  # config.otp_header_name = 'AG-2FA-TOKEN'

  # 2FA Send From Number. This is the Twilio number we will send from.
  config.twilio_send_from = 'YOUR_NUMBER' # formatted with country code, e.g. +18005551234

  # Twilio Account SID and token (used with two-factor authentication). These can be found
  # in your account.
  config.twilio_id = 'YOUR_TWILIO_SID'
  config.twilio_token = 'YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN'
end
```

*Note: Restart your server when done for the changes to take effect.*

#### Enabling 2FA for a user

To enable 2FA for a user, you will post their phone number, country code, and password to the API. You will need a valid access token. The user must supply their password in order to verify that it is the proper person to add a phone number to their record.

```sh
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
-H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" \
-d \
'{
    "data": {
        "id": "USER_ID_HERE",
        "type": "users",
        "attributes": {
            "phone_number": "8005551234",
            "country_code": "1",
            "password": "password"
        }
    }
}' \
'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/USER_ID_HERE/add_phone'
```

The user will receive an SMS message with a six digit code. You will need to send it to the API in order to verify the phone number. This must be completed within 60 seconds of sending the code.

```sh
curl -X POST \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
-H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json" \
-d \
'{
    "data": {
        "id": "USER_ID_HERE",
        "type": "users",
        "attributes": {
            "otp": "SIX_DIGIT_SMS_CODE",
        }
    }
}' \
'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users/USER_ID_HERE/verify_phone'
```

The user will receive a confirmation SMS and the verification is now complete.

#### Authenticating a user with 2FA

Authenticating with 2FA enabled is mostly the same as standard authentication using a password grant. Make the authentication request like normal:

```sh
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d \
'{
    "email": "travis@lookitsatravis.com",
    "password": "password",
    "grant_type": "password"
}' \
'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/token'
```

If the user has 2FA enabled, you will get a 402 response with a code of `two_factor_required`. The server will send the OTP to the user via SMS, and the client should present the user with a form to submit the code. When this happens, you will resubmit the access token request with an additional header (`AG-2FA-TOKEN` is the default value, though this is configurable) where the value is the OTP.

```sh
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "AG-2FA-TOKEN: SIX_DIGIT_SMS_CODE" \
-d \
'{
    "email": "travis@lookitsatravis.com",
    "password": "password",
    "grant_type": "password"
}' \
'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/token'
```

If done properly, you should be rewarded with an access token. If the OTP is incorrect or has expired, you will simply get a 401 http status invalid_grant response and you must start again.

## Configuration

ApiGuardian is intended to be configured with sensible defaults, but it is inevitable
that changes will need to be made from one application to another. Any changes
should be made in the initializer (`config/initializers/api_guardian.rb`) created
during installation. There are more options available than what is outlined here,
but these are the most common changes you're likely to make.

### Customizing Access Token Expiration

```rb
ApiGuardian.configure do |config|
  # ...

  # Access token expiration time (default 2 hours).
  config.access_token_expires_in = 2.weeks

  # ...
end
```

### Configuring JWT

You can customize the JWT issuer included in the payload as well as the secret
used for signing the token. *Note: You must chant the JWT secret. Requests will fail
if it is `nil` or the default value is used.*


```rb
ApiGuardian.configure do |config|
  # ...

  # JSON Web Tokens are used as the OAuth2 access token. Generating the JWT can
  # be configured in the following ways:
  #
  # The JWT issuer can be configured. The default is 'api_guardian_' with the
  # current version of ApiGuardian appended.
  config.jwt_issuer = 'my_app'
  #
  # The JWT secret can be customized to improve security of the JWT payload. By
  # default, a simple secret token is used. But, if you're using RS* encoding, you
  # must specify the path to your secret key.
  config.jwt_secret = 'changeme'
  config.jwt_secret_key_path = 'path/to/file.pem'
  #
  # The Encryption Method can use any of the valid methods found in
  # https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt. The default is HMAC 256.
  config.jwt_encryption_method = :hs256

  # ...
end
```
