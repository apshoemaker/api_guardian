# Contributing to ApiGuardian

1) Do not post questions in the issues tracker. If you have any questions about ApiGuardian, search the [Wiki](https://github.com/lookitsatravis/api_guardian/wiki) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/api_guardian).

2) If you find a security bug, **DO NOT** submit an issue here. Please send an e-mail to [travis@lookitsatravis.com](mailto:travis@lookitsatravis.com) instead.

3) Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to see if it was already reported / fixed.

4) When reporting an issue, include Rails and ApiGuardian versions. If you are getting exceptions, please include the full backtrace.

5) Notice that all of your interactions in the project are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

That's it! The more information you give, the easier it becomes for us to track it down and fix it.
Ideally, you should provide an application that reproduces the error or a test case to ApiGuardian's suite.

Thanks!
